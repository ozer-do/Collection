# Neon

Hey hey,

Few basic ideas on key milestones after the fundraise.

In relation to jobs to be done at Neon vs my role.

Three key jobs to be done in my opinion:

1. Prove that we can build, ship and have happy early customers: 3-9 mos
2. Prove that we can enable at least one repeatable sales play: 9-18 mos
3. Prove that early customers want to stay around and want to promote: next round of funding

In general, folks who lead go-to-market efforts for enterprise SaaS generally have one of these areas covered at any point in time. They at times stay close to the product, at times they are the closest thing to our customers before a sale, or are able to make existing customers really happy by enabling them to make a difference wtihin their business by using the product.

It is the common sense approach and will allow you to tackle one big challenge at a time.

But… generally… this works if you have all the resources of the company well funded, priorities of the team well defined and the market behaving quite predictably.

For a startup at its early stage, these conditions unfortunately won’t be there. Hence the higher risk, higher reward equation. All these conditions will become true over time if the bet is the right one but not initially. So being fast on your feet while juggling these three product-to-customer efforts will be key to success.

There are a lot more on the how, what, why we can discuss live. But as a summary.. I would like to keep the ball near the ball as close to the opponent’s goal post as possible during the entire game at each of the early stage matches while using all three key sections of the soccer pitch (how about for a World Cup reference huh?!?).

It is not natural for many in our industry to do so. I tend to thrive in it - covering all three areas when / where necessary - and honestly it has been my silver bullet in being able to survive in startup / early stage teams.

If we get to partner up, this is where I should be able to make a difference. If we do, we can then call this role something that makes sense for both sides and start planning to put campaigns (happy to share live what I mean by this term) on the whiteboard with themes, goals, timelines and all.

Let me know what you think and if you have a preference in connecting live one of these days: happy to drive up to the city and run through this at the Regus office.

Cheers,
