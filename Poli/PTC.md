Product to Customer  
Questions to answer, steps to follow  
Every product offer is different: primary audience, target verticals, market dynamics based on vertical and regional exposure, ideal customer profile and budget center, sales motion details and several other factors play a role — in addition to the past experience of the founding team.  
With these different pieces we should be mindful of, here are some steps that might be helpful as you try to figure out how to bring your product to customers. Lack of clarity on any of these topics usually comes back to haunt you sooner or later. You will not have the right answers to these statements on day one and most likely it will take you a few years — start by doing while keeping this list in the back of your mind.

The "Why?"  
Brand promise: simply put, this is what you want your team to be remembered by. When people hear your brand, see your corporate logo, they should remember instantly what you stand for. You want your leadership team be very clear on what this simple 5–6 word statement is — especially during the early days as you are trying to form a strong foundation. And new team members should associate with such a statement and believe in its value long term. It will help save the day when you are faced with toughest of the challenges. Ideally it should not change for many years to come.  
The story: you need to have a clear answer to the question "why should anyone care?", primarily for the creative members of your team: engineers, designers, and other makers. The story should be a reflection of changes and motions in the world, outside of your control, that are creating many inspiring reasons for innovation and opportunities for market growth. The story is what comes within the 2–3 minutes after you state your business vision. It will evolve over time since the market cannot stay constant.  
Technology vision: evolving over time, it is a high-level of description for the set of innovations you want to bring to market in order to serve your business vision. It's more tangible. It's tied to specific product features that are unique and possibly disruptive to other existing offers. When your product management team needs to think of the next big release, and when they need to convince customers about why your offer is better, it will help guide them in the right direction. Multiple and frequent iterations might be required.  
Team culture: read my three piece series, every leadership team will be different. People first, customer second.

The "How?"  
Audience: who do we want to sell the product? Habits, Community  
Roadmap: what are our principles, mission statements? Explain how you are planning to serve the needs of this audience in the short term. Change it every 6-month increments.  
Metrics: how do we want the tool to be adopted? Growth. Market is the market. Make sure you learn from unexpected growth.  
Problems: what are our customers challenges? Your version of the problem statement will be wrong, listen to what they have to say.  
Solutions: what do we promise to our customers? Craft. And customer's version of the solution will be wrong, they have to use what your engineers build. Engineering craft will be the answer to their problems.
