# Data

## Data industry overview

- Note: there’s a lot of overlap in some of these initial pieces
- [Emerging Architectures for Modern Data Infrastructure](https://future.com/emerging-architectures-modern-data-infrastructure/)
   - Start here, and maybe end here too. I found the original version of this hard to grok on the first read.
- [What I’ve learned about data recently](https://seldo.com/posts/what-i-ve-learned-about-data-recently)
- [2021 MAD Landscape](https://mattturck.com/data2021/): a brute with lots of unnecessary detail, but some pretty useful commentary/context
- [The one data platform to rule them all](https://leighmariebraswell.substack.com/p/the-one-data-platform-to-rule-them) - reasonably accessible overview
- [The State and Future of Data Tooling](https://podknife.com/episodes/the-state-and-future-of-data-tooling-with-leigh-marie-braswell-and-erik-bernhardsson) (podcast)
- [The Modern Data Stack: Past, Present, and Future](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/future-of-the-modern-data-stack/)
   - One of the most important posts here, if not the most important. Written by CEO of dbt, a key part of the “MDS” (36,000 people on the [dbt slack](https://www.getdbt.com/community/), which I recommend joining and lurking on the various BI channels)
- [Top BI tools of 2021](https://blog.panoply.io/top-25-business-intelligence-tools-and-how-to-decide)

## Further data-related thinking/context

- [Data is for dashboards](https://benn.substack.com/p/data-is-for-dashboards) – written by the founder of Mode Analytics
   - To me, there is a dichotomy between (A) certified/maintained and (B) ad hoc data/dashboards; this post implicitly focuses on (A). However, probably the majority of actual “dashboards” created are for (B). So ad hoc, stale “dashboards” accumulate and compete with “Purpose A” dashboards, creating data discovery/maintainability/trust issues.
   - In addition: making a great / nice dashboard is hard and time consuming because it is actually a data design PLU UX/UI design problem. Very few people can do this well; most dashboards are sucky.

- [Purple people](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/we-the-purple-people/) - has kind of taken hold as an idea

      - Possibly the most useful extract so far is from [Sep 2021](https://roundup.getdbt.com/p/from-rows-to-people)

## OODA

- [Intro to OODA](https://fs.blog/ooda-loop/)
   - our stated purpose is to make data accessible to anyone
      - that is in service of helping people to make better decisions, faster—i.e. driving the OODA loop—primarily by improving orientation and secondarily by enabling more implicit decisions
- [The Essence of Winning and Losing](https://fasttransients.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/essence_of_winning_losing.pdf) - the canonical OODA reference slide(s)
