# 5. Category

Category design is about so much more than just getting customers to pay attention and understand the value of your product or service. It’s about redesigning the world so that it aligns with your point of view. Sometimes this requires new thinking. Other times, new laws or significant infrastructure changes.

****Radically Different Benefit (For A Radically Different Problem) ******

*“What is a radically different benefit we can offer the customer/end user?”*

The customer is never buying “the thing” your product or service does. What they’re buying is the outcome or result of them using “the thing.” The benefit of your product or service is not the sum of its features. It’s the transformation it unlocks in the customer as a result.

Companies that fall in love with solving *new, different* problems, or successfully reframe existing problems in new and different ways, are the ones with the most clarity about the benefit(s) of providing a solution. Having a radically different benefit reflects the company’s desire to solve a radically different problem.

So, how do you find a radically different problem? Here is one way: Change the “who,” “what,” “when,” “why,” and “how” of the problem - aka. the positioning. When you solve a problem for a “super consumer”, your odds of finding a radically different problem to solve & a radically different benefit to bring to the market go up.

**Radically Different Brand**

*“What are some radically different brands consumers can choose from?”*

Brands that are missionaries, on the other hand, evangelize a broader category problem that, when fixed, creates a rising tide that lifts all boats. They have founders who have personally experienced the pain of a broken category, and have made it their life’s mission to fix it.

Branding only becomes a differentiator when, ***in the context of the broader category,*** the branding is executed in a radically different way *than what is expected. Unexpected* branding decision make it clear who is *not* your customer—which is often more powerful than declaring who *is* your customer.

****Radically Different Experience ******

*“How can we make the experience so distinct that it is worthy of a price premium?”*

The way you avoid commoditization is to migrate from goods to products to services to experiences to transformation at the highest level—and explains how a radically different experience tends to fall into one of two categories: **“time well saved”** and **“time well spent.”** This is an incredibly simple way to be empathetic towards the consumer, which most companies struggle to do.

- How much of the category is fun that can be enhanced?
- And how much of the category is a chore that can be minimized.

**Radically Different Price**

*“How can we change the way consumers perceive value that is radically different?”*

- How much value does my category create, especially for my Superconsumers?
- How much value is created or destroyed by the *way I price*, specifically “who I charge,” “when I charge,” “where I charge,” and “why I charge?”

Price anchored to your Supers means pricing your product/service outside of the expectations of the everyday consumer. This is how you achieve *radically different pricing.* Price can also be a status symbol. Price can be a differentiator. Price can be a statement about your company and product, and about the people who buy it, use it, wear it, and tell other people about it.

Did YETI invent the cooler? Of course not. What they created instead was the *premium* cooler—and a whole new category *ten times* more expensive than its nearest competitor.

This is what Category Designers do: they change the way people value what they value. Remember, nothing is intrinsically valuable. We get *taught* to value certain things and devalue others. Nothing is “valuable” until someone teaches someone else how to value it.

What makes a customer buy is when they feel they can receive the same benefits for a dramatically lower price, or exponentially more benefits for the same or slightly higher price—or some other variation of the equation: Value = Benefits/Price, where “Value” is the outcome and “Benefits” or “Price” are the variables.

**Radically Different Manufacturing**

*“What radically different way can we make what we market?”*

When it comes to manufacturing, the vast majority of companies focus on efficiency and optimization—namely, “Can we make it cheaper and/or more capital efficient?” This is fine, but it assumes the category is fixed and will not change. It also assumes customers don’t care about anything other than price.

**Radically Different Distribution**

*“How might we distribute/sell what we offer in a totally unique manner?”*

It’s about power and leverage. Category creators don’t wait for their customers to come to them. They go to where their consumers already are—specifically where they work, live, and play. The company’s distribution strategy is a crucial lever within their broader category design and business strategy. The highest-scoring category creators turn their distribution costs into revenue streams. Distribution comes to them—and furthermore, it pays them in the process.

“What hook can we create that drives our our “super consumers” to spread our new category and offering virally and organically?”

**Radically Different Marketing**

*“How might we drive category awareness/consideration in a way no one else does?”*

When people see a company marketing the category (not their product), they assume the company doing the marketing is the category leader. Because the only companies they’ve ever seen market their respective categories are category leaders. *Instead of marketing your product*, what you should be marketing is *your Point Of View of the category.*

- Software’s OLD category point of view: “The business model for software is to buy it. And run it ‘on-premise.’” Salesforce’s NEW category point of view: “The business model for software is to rent it. And let us run it for them in the cloud.”
- Coffee’s OLD category point of view: “The only way to drink coffee is one pot and one flavor for all.” Keurig’s NEW category point of view: “The best way to enjoy coffee is one cup of your personal choice—with a Keurig.”

The POV frames a new problem your category identifies with and sets *you* up as the answer. Which is why your POV is, fundamentally, a “story” about how people can move from the way they are currently experiencing the category, to the (new) way they can and should experience the category *they didn’t know they wanted.*

The POV is so important that in the most radical cases, the POV of the company becomes part of the customer’s identity. “I’m a coffee drinker” is not just a statement about a preference. It’s a statement about *who* that person is.

Marketing’s job is to put the right words into the right mouths. By having a radically different POV of your product/company’s category, what you are *really* doing is giving customers the script you’d like them to use when talking about you to friends, family, and the world at large.

Point of view has nothing to do with the company’s brand, and everything to do with its radically different and transformational perspective of the category itself. Such companies are not betting on the world being the same. They are betting on the world, specifically the category they are creating or re-designing, being *different.*

Companies deploying radically different marketing do not do brand-to-brand comparisons. They facilitate past-to-future category discussions. They attack the past and declare the category of the future. The *customer*, and the transformation you are able to facilitate in them, is the main character and focal point of the story. Brands are about companies. Categories are about customers.

1. Evangelize the problem, not the solution
2. Facilitate a conversation between consumers (don’t just talk at consumers)
3. Get Supers to “geek out” and let others listen in versus hogging the microphone (today this is called creating “community”)
4. Focus on the benefits, not the features
5. Spotlight the value, not the price
6. Emphasize earned media, not paid
7. Customize vs. one-size fits all
8. Measure vs. hope and pray
9. Turn founders, executives, and employees into category ambassadors (today the “E” in CEO stands for evangelist)

When you market the category, and the category is something people have never heard of before—*and it’s new, is radically different, provides transformational outcomes, etc.*—suddenly you are seen as authentic. You are seen as educational. You are a missionary on a mission. You’re the O.G., the real deal. Instead of talking about yourself (brand/company), you want to talk about the customer in the context of this new and different problem (evangelizing the category). Of which you happen to be the only solution.

**Radically Different Profit Model**

*“How can we make money that is radically different from others?”*

If you have the same profit model as everyone else, you’re doomed to commoditization. If you only have ONE profit model versus multiple, you’re as screwed as a boxer trying to fight an MMA fighter. If your profit model is based on transactions vs. lifetime value, you’ll always worry about your customers leaving you for a handsomer, younger, and richer version of you. If you don’t know and aren’t in the 9 other categories your Supers are also Supers in, your marketing will always be a cost center versus a profit center. If you don’t have a strategy to turn every line-item expense into a revenue generator like Amazon, you will always be looking over your shoulder for Amazon to take away your business.

Lever 8 makes other companies say, “That’s not fair.” And they are right. Which means for your differentiation moat to be the defensive force you hope it to be, *you* have to get this lever right. How you make the money, matters.

**Closing**

Your goal is to *clearly, articulately, and specifically* differentiate yourself from the legacy ***category**—*and then widen the distance between the old and new in these 8 core areas. Think of these 8 levers as extensions of your category point of view, and as a powerful mechanism to move the world *from* the way it is, *to* the way you want it to be.

You’re different. You’ve forced a choice. Not a comparison.

# **How To Frame, Name, And Claim A Category**

When you invent the language to solve a problem, you become the trusted authority to educate people on the definition of that new language—and subsequently, that new category.

### **Step 1: Frame a different problem/opportunity.**

The goal is to create distinctions between old and new, same and different.

Here are a few examples from category leaders:

- **StitchFix**: Busy people don’t have time to shop for clothes, but they want nice clothes that fit their unique style.
- **Vinebox:** Buying an entire bottle of premium wine, only to not enjoy what you’ve just bought, is a terrible experience.
- **Netflix:** You should be able to watch anything you want, whenever you want.

### **Step 2: Evangelize a different future.**

Stand in a different future, and live “as if” that different future already exists today.

- **StitchFix:** Receive curated boxes of clothing, selected just for you by a team of stylists.
- **Vinebox:** Get vials of premium wine by the glass delivered to your door.
- **Netflix:** Instantly “stream” movies and TV shows, instead of waiting for an “appointment viewing” at a set time.

### **Step 3: Show customers how your “solution” bridges the gap from the problem/opportunity to a different future.**

This step lets you highlight the unspoken qualities of your category point of view.

- **StitchFix:** Keep the clothes you like, and return what you don’t.
- **Vinebox:** If you like it, you can order a full bottle.
- **Netflix:** Stream shows on your schedule, instead of planning your life around them.
