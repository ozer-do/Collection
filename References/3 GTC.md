# 3 GTC

# 3. GTC

- Mobile First Platform is presented in three buckets (as opposed to 7+ today) under three major software brands
- Software brands are defined by the audience they serve and the budget center they go after in the customer deployment
- Each would have its own independent Go-To-Customer model defined, while leveraging the traditional Aruba GTM
- To support the GTC model, each would have its own product branding that’s designed to create communities of fans to scale
- Their ecosystem partners, as part of a single ecosystem program for Aruba, would be mapped to Aruba resellers to fuel growth
- Aruba wired, wireless, WAN infrastructure would be positioned as “Cloud Ready” from edge to core to support platform services
