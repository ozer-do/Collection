8base

**HQ:** Miami

**Year founded:** 2017

**Total raised:** $15.2 million, according to the company

**What they do:** 8base is a low-code platform for building "serverless" web applications, meaning it takes care of the back-end programming for its users.

**Why you should bet your career on them:**As companies perpetually look for ways to maximize their IT budgets, 8base's platform could help developers save time and money by eliminating the need for "back-end" programming for some apps.

Since its launch, 8base has secured strategic customer partnerships as well with a mix of startup clients and big firms like IBM and NATO. The startup is also a Techstars accelerator alum and raised a fresh $10.6 million Series A round in 2022.

**Total funding raised:** $300 million equity investments plus [$480 million in grants from the US Department of Energy](https://ascendelements.com/ascend-elements-awarded-480m-in-grants-from-u-s-department-of-energy-to-manufacture-sustainable-battery-cathode-active-materials/), according to the company

**What it does:** Ascend Elements makes sustainable lithium-battery materials and offers battery recycling.

**Why you should bet your career on them:**The climate crisis calls for a push away from fossil fuels, making electric-battery development a crucial part of transitioning to green energy.

Ascend Elements will significantly reduce the risk around acquiring and using these materials with its "[hydro-to-cathode](https://www.businessinsider.com/ascend-elements-series-c-electric-vehicle-battery-recycling-supply-chain-2022-10)" tech that recycles the materials and processes them at the same time so they can go straight back into supply chains.

The team is also well-off when it comes to cash on hand. Last fall, the team raised a nearly $800 million Series C round with a combination of venture funding and grants from the Department of Energy.

During the pandemic, it [grew revenue by more than 50% annually](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-hr-tech-startup-gusto-won-over-investors-small-businesses-2022-9), [a source told Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-hr-tech-startup-gusto-won-over-investors-small-businesses-2022-9). So, when Wall Street's taste for IPOs returns, many believe that Gusto will take that step and become a public company sooner rather than later. By targeting small and medium-sized businesses, the startup is targeting a demographic largely ignored by the biggest players in the tech industry, which favors working with the lucrative enterprise market. It hasn't been without strife, in this tough economy, though. In early February, [CEO Josh Reeves announced he had laid off 126 employees](https://gusto.com/company-news/josh-reeves-message-to-all-gusto), or about 5%.

It landed a [hefty $8 million seed round last year](https://www.businessinsider.com/youth-mental-health-tech-startup-hopscotch-pitch-deck-funding-2022-9).

**HQ:** New York

**Year founded:** 2016

**Total raised:** $38.5 million, according to the company

**What they do:** Joonko is an AI-powered candidate-sourcing-and-recruiting platform focused on underrepresented talent.

**Why you should bet your career on them:**It's been proven that having diverse teams from a variety of backgrounds can [improve the likelihood](https://www.businessinsider.com/benefits-of-diverse-companies-2017-3) of a company's success, yet many tech startups remain sorely lacking in this department.

Joonko is working to change this, and already has a talent pool of over 100,000 candidates from diverse and underrepresented backgrounds to fill vacancies at large companies like Adidas and PayPal.

The startup raised a [$25 million Series B](https://www.businessinsider.com/pitch-deck-diversity-equity-inclusion-raise-million-joonko-recruiting-tech-2022-9)round that Insight Partners led last September, so it will have a good chunk of cash on hand going into a tougher year for VC fundraising.

[Kumo.ai](http://Kumo.ai)'s main product is as simple to use as constructing an SQL database query, something many in the data world can already do, and it offers such tools at an attractive price point.

Investors have been receptive to [Kumo.ai](http://Kumo.ai)'s pitch: the startup raised an $18 million Series B round back in September, which Sequoia led, with participation from A.Capital, SV Angels, and several angel investors.

**Why you should bet your career on them:**Online advertising can be a notoriously difficult way to attract new customers to your company's website, and if an ad does bring in clicks, it can be tough to then convert a page view into a paying customer.

The Y Combinator-backed Mutiny uses OpenAI's GPT-3 engine to generate target language on their websites based on its own customer data and successful copy from other websites so advertisements are more likely to lead to sales as a user clicks through.

It's a pitch that Tiger Global and Insight Partners found convincing last year, and they led Mutiny's $50 million Series B at a $600 million valuation in April 2022. Mutiny already has huge enterprise clients like Dropbox and Carta, [TechCrunch first reported](https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/20/mutiny-which-personalizes-website-copy-and-headlines-using-ai-raises-50m/), and has doubled the size of its team to 81 employees going into 2023, according to its [Y Combinator profile](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/mutiny).
