- Product led > faster conversion
- Enablement > faster education

**Why do we care?**

We need to accelerate how we build connections across the company given important initiatives. Larger the company gets, more important this becomes.

**What do we want?**

Business goals and outcomes that we can easily get aligned on, with results all can “understand” across the company. If it is more than “3 things” per initiative, it’s too much.

**How do we do it?**

1. Build the foundation for each initiative: owner, key definitions, alignment on goals, outcomes desired, reviews with Rajeev on key questions to answer
2. Promote the initiative and goals: “influence without authority calendar” for cross-functional meetings, asynch comms, offsites to gather continuous input
3. Turn an initiative into an operation: clear report on maturity, pass the Ozer smell test, ready for e-staff roundtables, QBRs, board meetings, all hands

Repeat across all initiatives across the company on an ongoing basis. Repetition brings momentum, momentum brings results.
