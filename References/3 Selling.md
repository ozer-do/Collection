# 3 Selling

# 3. Selling

Here is how I have been “selling” Aruba software portfolio to our channel and our direct sales team members - first it helped grab attention, which then received positive reaction. Primary question is “how does a sales guy make money by selling Aruba?”

Nothing visionary, or related to mission statements - just thinking through the third question in my email below from July as practically as possible.

- Sell Aruba Phase 1: Infrastructure (controllers with licenses, variety of APs) — Perpetual, on-prem — revenue potential = $$$$$
- Sell Aruba Phase 2: Software (ClearPass, AirWave) helping us differentiate — Perpetual, on-prem servers — revenue potential = $
- *NEW* Sell Aruba Phase 3: Applications (Central, Introspect, Meridian, NetInsight) — SaaS, primarily cloud-based — revenue potential = $ to start with, but $$$$$$ over time

In order to reduce “time to close”, phase 2 & 3 should be targeted against infrastructure install base — extracting more revenue from an existing customer is the best route for account managers to gain quarterly revenue momentum in their territories as they are faced with ever increasing quotas.

As opposed to other two, success for phase 3 is measured with metrics around the cost of acquiring, maintaining and monetizing a customer. It calls for extra investment from the business to increase customer count and turn the negative cash flow into positive over time, not on day one… as the revenue is fueled via customer success / renewals.

I am kicking off the “sell location services to Aruba WLAN install base enablement program" during Global Sales Summit end of January — first target is healthcare and corporate campus in North America, targeting a total of 300,000 access points (estimated 600MSQFT). Message is simple: “bring home $200 US list per AP per year by selling Meridian”. Hoping to see more sales teams better understand and adopt "phase 3” selling.
