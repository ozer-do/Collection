\# Building a Great Team Culture  
\#\# With two important ingredients  
\!\[Özer Dondurmacıoğlu\]

\#\# 1\. Randomness  
If you hear someone come up with a new, great idea around the edges of the "box", it is quite likely that it is a result of a conversation with a customer. It is expected that customers come up with better ideas than you do, and that you are here to serve their business — not the other way around.  
With a genius idea on the table and better outcomes on the horizon, do not be afraid to change direction. Re-evaluate, re-calculate. The title of the person does not matter. Deadlines, launch trackers and certainly a pre-defined "process" do not matter. Even if it seems like you just do not have the time to adjust, you have to do the right thing and work your butt off to turn the new idea into reality.  
It served us well: competed and beat countless competitors over the years — only one standing still. Although this approach sounds good in writing — sounds "*Inspirational\!*" — in practice, it will drive you crazy, you need to be patient with it. Some of us blame ourselves for not coming up with the better idea in the first place. Some just don't care and move on. And some just cannot bear the thought of changing direction in the middle of a step-by-step perfect plan. The reality is you cannot control everything — and as a marketeer you are destined to do your best work when you just let go of your worries and timelines, and listen what's right in front of you. Plus, trying to predict the future does not serve anyone well.  
After breathing this in for a few months, everyone starts to realize that unexpected, random events help define our success. We have learned to love randomness. More game changing events we plow through, faster we innovate. And if things are not changing last minute, and we are maintaining status quo for a long period of time… we start to twitch. We have learned to enjoy not being comfortable in our seats.  
\#\# 2\. Uncertainty  
So at the end of every interview, I ask candidates to be honest with themselves about if they can bear the thought of letting go when necessary to do the right thing and follow the lead of the others, independent of their title and status in the company.  
If that goes well, we start talking about how we intentionally avoid micro-management as much as possible. Let's face it — we are all humans with tendency to overstep in our ability to manage others and exercise fear of letting go more than we should. But there is a very good reason for you to constantly try to eliminate your tendencies to micro manage.  
It simply fuels creativity and keeps people accountable for the work they do. It forces people to think around the edges of the box after they are left alone to imagine and create. The uncertainty and fear of not getting line by line direct instructions from your boss fuels the natural instincts in everyone to survive and do better than the ones before you or next to you.  
And listening your boss list out every single piece of work you are supposed to do this week just does the opposite — if you are not creating and following orders, your natural energy to create is wasted on spending more time on your favorite social network.  
So the lack of micro-management comes at a cost of uncertainty and having to work harder with greater stress — but for the most creative souls out there, this is exactly the type of culture they would rather be part of. Plus, it all feels quite good at the end when the product launches with a killer headline on the homepage banner of your website.

\# Habits of your audience  
\#\# For peace of mind, try to adapt what you do  
\!\[Özer Dondurmacıoğlu\]

Tune in while you read:  
It's a constant struggle to find the feature, license, pricing, positioning you need to move the needle in your business of selling any type of high technology products. Last several quarters, as the general manager at meridianapps.com, post my product marketing role, I have learned a valuable lesson through first hands experience.  
Defining who your audiences are as part of your go to market motion is job number one. In other words, how many different groups of people need to learn about what a product team has created before a customer risks their money and/or jobs paying for your product and service?  
At Aruba Meridian, we have 12 different audiences, between the product and the customer, given the size and scale of the organization. Examples of questions we try to answer are as follows — and there are many more:  
\- How is your channel partner incentivized today to sell your existing line of products? How does IT organization ask for funding to create budget for your technology?  
\- What are the existing gross margin profiles your ecosystem partners and professional services organization target to sell your line of products?  
\- Where (vertical / region) are your sales team members are comfortable in selling your existing products to satisfy their quota?  
\- How does an engineer install and support your existing set of technology using which tools?  
In a nutshell, you should not being doing things that goes against the behavior and habits of your audience as a product team: if you do, you will get more friction in your sales motion than you need. You can improve what and how they sell / buy over time, but start with an understanding of their current state of mind to gain attention and establish growth.  
\> Don't ask them to adopt a new habit — not right away.  
I recommend creating your own list of audiences, their habits and questions you should answer. Do it for the engineers and makers in your team. It would be a shame wasting their efforts in creating something out of nothing — just because you could not figure how you should take advantage of existing habits of your audience to move the business forward.

\# Community first  
\#\# Sales second

Tune in while you read:  
\#\# Why build a community for your product or service?  
After they invest in what you do and put their job on the line as they invested in what you offer, the least you can do is to create an environment where they feel that they are not alone. I know — relatively dark explanation of the relationship but it is important to pay attention to. In that environment, your members will give you the cold-hard-truth when they see problems and their approval of what you do will force you to keep moving. To be honest, not sure how any product company survives with a community.  
\#\# What would the community members want?  
They need to believe that you as the product team will have their back with answers when they are in the middle of a challenge. They need to know you are listening, customizing product features based on their preference, publishing content based on their interests — and only if it will help them get better at their jobs.  
\#\# How do you engage with them on digital?  
It's 2018\. Make sure your community site is mobile friendly. Make sure you use the same member ID on the web, on mobile, at events, during webinars and anything in between. Make sure your CRM keeps track of their community activities — not just what they bougth from you. If you want to prioritize your engagement with them based on their contribution to your business with respect to recurring revenue, that's ok… it will help you create a membership program for your most loyal fans that spend the most with you and that's normal… but $$$ cannot be the only metric.  
\#\# How should you craft your calendar of activities?  
First, don't call it an editorial calendar. Start by doing, not by punching titles and ideas on an Excel spreadsheet. Simply grab a list of contacts and start emailing / calling: your best sales reps, your most critical pre-sales solution architects, your most creative engineers who actually built your product, and most importantly, your most loyal fans in the community. Ask them what you should be talking about and amplifying the most. Just package of those ideas, create a theme per month, and run with it — 12 themes per year. Keep live webinars, email communications, community events, social media posts well aligned with those themes every month.  
\#\# How do you manage community vs. corporate website?  
There is absolutely no reason to keep them separate. Make community created content part of your content mix on the web and vice versa: digital experience should be interlinked as much as possible. Your community event keynote should be on the home page of your website. Your live webinars should accept live comments from the community within your prime digital real-estate on the web. If your content on the web is not ready for easy social sharing, you are just leaving too many opportunities for engagement on the table; customers will buy from you, but your community of fans will sell for you. Invite them to the party but make sure they get a chance to invite their friends as guests . You want your message to go viral — easier said than done — but it is a much better route than trying to build a louder microphone compared to your competitors.  
\#\# Will this improve your content readership?  
Not in the short term. It will help you stop caring about a good portion of your content and marketing metrics by design in the long term. Content creation, event organizing, product building will be an effort to serve the community members — more than something you do for the clicks. If the email open rates in the industry are less than 1%, that means it is time to stop caring about those numbers — because they are literally less than 1%. Just like the most meaningful relationships in your personal life, play the long game.  
\#\# How do you create a personalized experience?  
Be respectful in every community member's privacy. Give them the option to choose a customized experience when they interact with your brand on digital and at events. If they registered to one your online webinars for instance: next time they login, you should thank them for joining… similar to how you would acknowledge your friend after meeting her for dinner the other night. It's personable, shows empathy and it's the normal thing to do.

Motivating customers to buy  
A partnership story between product management and product marketing

Engineering teams are responsible in delivering a highly differentiated set of features and capabilities against a meaningful product vision.

Their product management counterparts are responsible for such vision, and they need to care for before (e.g. finding the ideal market) and after (e.g. proper customer success and support) the release of that product.

Product management is responsible for most clear positioning of the product to capture as much of that market as possible. Product marketing is not supposed to have the final say in product positioning: although it is usually assumed to be the case.

The reason for this false assumption is the slight difference between why buyers are motivated to invest in the product vs. what the product is positioned for. It is a constant struggle to see the difference as the product offer evolves.

With variety of methods (e.g. digital marketing campaigns, market outreach with influencers, community events, etc), marketing can only influence the motivation to buy — not why & how engineers should build a great product to solve an inspirational problem that needs to be tackled.

If marketing fails to deliver on motivating the target audience to buy, they are not helping sales — but worse, they are not helping product management and engineering teams to scale their efforts, and better understand how the market dynamics are changing over time.

Many marketing teams help package what product management has already created or assume the role of leading product positioning. This will only survive short-term. Best marketing teams constantly redefine and create new ways in influencing motivation to buy. The challenge of being responsible for this crucial piece of the puzzle end-to-end will keep best creators and marketing professionals as part of their teams long-term.

Tune in while you read:

Always a challenge to keep all parties in your team excited about what and how to build. Engineers are artists & creators, and they need to inspired and shown success of what they have shipped. Product and design teams need to feel they have the support of the engineering team when customers come calling on a Friday afternoon. Support and sales teams need to trust that the promises to paying customers will be kept.

\> All of this can be done. But it’s not easy.

Here is practical advice, which I still have to see myself pay attention to or perfect it, depending where we are as a team in the process. Just like any great meal, the true secret ingredient to get there is the human touch.

\> Secret ingredient: targeted, candid, factual and frequent communication among all.

\#\# Communicate the big bet

If you are the team lead, over-communicate the answer to the “why do we exist?” or the “what’s happening in the world that opens the door for us to do what we do?” question to everyone in the team. It’s your simple vision statement with a 2-min story about what’s changing in the world: I realized that I pitch this to customers and prospects dozen times a week. But I have told the story to my team may be five times in the last five quarters, if that. It’s not the responsibility of your people managers — it’s yours as the one at the helm. And if it is not written down; start scribbling now and publish it for everyone to see. I realized that I have been wasting the efforts of several in the team due to lack of clarity on this topic: acting like a fog, it has prevented them to take immediate action towards progress where they see a need. Small discussions turned into bigger problems that were tackled in many more hours than needed.

\#\# First, discuss people

One-on-ones and staff meetings need to open with ‘people first’: “How are the team dynamics? Are our new members adjusting to the flow of things? Do we have frustrations in the team that need to be heard?”

If we do not constantly communicate along these questions and listen, we cannot form trust across the team. If there is lack of trust in the professional relationship, it is hard for anyone to be empathetic towards other’s needs… and without empathy, we have no reason help each other out, aim to craft the best product we can, and stay enthusiastic about what we do.

\#\# Encourage individual growth

Business and product growth might be there, but everyone in the team should be guided towards their personal and professional growth. This should be visible to everyone in the team as much as possible, starting with their managers. Team does it together, everyone benefits from the growth, or they might as well not try at all — it’s not as interesting the other way around. That level of inspiration does not only ship one feature, but it starts building something that’s highly differentiated and never-before-seen — something that’s going to deliver the highest revenue growth in the long run, and something no customer has had the foresight to request it yet. Given enough inspiration and reason, your team would already be putting their efforts to translating the strong culture to the future of your product.

\#\# Document your sales motion

After your ship your product — especially if it is an infrastructure dependent SaaS product for enterprise IT teams B2B — there will be a period of activities that get you, your sales teams, your channel and your customers ready to use the product in large scale. This will help you start figuring out when exactly you should aim to start tracking return on investment within your organization as to the value of the features of your product.

Generally, in the sales motion, you need to first start by promoting the product — who it is for, why someone should care, and how it is differentiated. Then you get on many meetings and calls answering questions, while engineering makes it perfect as they fix few unexpected bugs. In few of those calls, customers decide that they want to give it a go during an evaluation period: in other words, your primary audience is trying to confirm that your product works as advertised before they put their job on the line and start promoting your solution internally within their organization. Don’t forget: you are not the one selling to a procurement department, your champion is. After the purchase, implementation phase starts and might last for months: if you are developer facing technology product, for instance. After rolling out to production, your customer will wait for constructive feedback and reviews from the initial pilot users of the service since they are the ultimate judge of quality and usefulness: which might take another few months.

Once this process is clearly explained with examples, everyone starts getting on the same page about what it takes to sell, to keep those customers happy and turn your champions into heroes in their organization. Besides providing visibility, all in the team can have the right expectations in seeing results for their hard work in the short and long run.

Tune in while you read:

Many (if not all) of the early stage tech startups are aiming to answer a common set of questions as they… start, accelerate, grow, repeat. There is no secret sauce in answering these questions in the best way possible — just hard work and lots of trial & error — but even the list of the questions itself could be useful. Here are the ones that I have ran into most after my last full-time gig at Aruba (the company).

  1\. What’s the story and the technology vision (easy to understand and to repeat) for the rest of the market to hear?  
  2\. What are the proof points that clearly demonstrate that this is a monster market? What are the factors outside of the company’s control that are contributing to the growth of this market with multiple big waves of investment / innovation?  
  3\. What are the voices (frequently listened by the market) and credentials (past success and trust by the market) that the founding team bring to the table?  
  4\. How is the team’s culture designed to support taking a major role in this market? How will this culture reflected in the brand promise — since companies are defined by the people in it and not the other way around?  
  5\. What are the strong (tangible, not anecdotal) factors & data points that make this time “the right time” and the target vertical \+ region mix “the right place”?  
  6\. What is the category that the company will create to easily differentiate its unique value prop in this monster market?  
  7\. What are the practical methods that can be used to onboard the first group of community members from customers and partners? Such a community, in the long run, will be the first line of defense against the competition within the monster market and source of continuous innovation in the respective category.  
  8\. Given the status of the market and the customer needs, what should be the top-3 differentiation points against the status quo and/or competitors that are being disrupted with company’s offer? What should be the roadmap for this top-3 to further widen the gap in the years to come?  
  9\. What should the cycle of app development and team structure look like as company takes the product to customers? Quarterly roadmap delivery might include many or all of the following steps: Define (Audience and Problems), Product Design, Engineering Prototype (Solutions), Release (Validate and Document), Promote (Key Use Cases), Ecosystem (Channel), Success (Adoption, NPS, Renewal)  
  10\. Given a vision for the team, culture, product, community… assuming the category and/or the market does not turn out to be what it was predicted to be, how can the company control its own destiny and the narrative in the market during such an unexpected downturn?

  1\. Try treating the layout with the same intensity you bring to the main idea. Don’t just arrange words and pictures. Invent a brand image for your client. Invent a look that dramatizes the product or service you are selling without regard for fashion.  
  2\. However fleetingly a viewer may see the ad, they must have at least a subconscious realization that they have been exposed to that particular company’s advertising. This is an invaluable benefit to your client.  
  3\. When we attend a lecture, we generally go to see the speaker not to hear what they have to say. We know what they have to say. That’s why we go to see them. Instead of giving people the benefit of your wit and wisdom (words), try painting them a picture. The more strikingly visual your presentation is, the more people will remember it. And more importantly, they will remember you.  
  4\. Being right is based upon knowledge and experience, and is often provable. Knowledge comes from the past so it’s safe. It is also out of date. It’s the opposite of originality. Experience is built from solutions to old situations and problems. If you got experience, you will probably use old solutions to new problems. This is lazy. Experience is the opposite of being creative.  
  5\. If you can prove you’re right, you’re set in concrete. You cannot move with the times or with other people. Being right is also being boring. Your mind is closed. You are not open to new ideas. It’s wrong to be right, because people who are right are rooted in the past, rigid-minded, dull and smug. There’s no talking to them.  
  6\. Start being wrong and suddenly anything is possible. You are no longer trying to be infallible. You are in the unknown. There is no way of knowing what can happen, but there’s more change of it being amazing than if you try to be right.  
  7\. Of course, being wrong is a risk. People worry about suggesting stupid ideas because of what others will think. Risks are measure of people. People who won’t take them are trying to preserve what they have. People who do take them often end up by having more.  
  8\. Find out what’s right about your product or service and then dramatize it, like a cartoonist exaggerates an action. Providing there is a basic truth in your idea, you can dramatize it to infinity.  
  9\. Here’s an example: “A radio commercial for suntan lotion. An Englishman’s voice tells of the product’s benefits. As he talks his voice gradually changes to that of a West Indian man.” Brilliant. You know a suntan lotion will not make you black, but you accept that it might make you brown.  
  10\. Avoid knocking the competition. It usually serves to publicize them rather than you. It may win attention, it may win awards but the likelihood is that it will not win sales. (It is also much easier to do.)  
  11\. Give away everything you know, and more will come back to you. You will remember from school other students preventing you from seeing their answers by their arm around their exercise book or exam paper. It is the same at work, people are secretive with ideas. ‘Don’t tell them that, they will take the credit for it.’  
  12\. The problem with hoarding is you end up living off your reserves. Eventually you will become stale. If you give away everything you have, you are left with nothing. This forces you to look, to be aware, to replenish. Somehow the more you give away the more comes back to you. Ideas are open knowledge. Don’t claim ownership. They are not your ideas anyway, they are someone else’s. They are out there floating by on the ether. You just have to put yourself in a frame of mind to pick them up.  
  13\. If you have produced a pleasantly acceptable piece fo work, you will have proved to yourself that it’s good simply because others have said so. It is probably ok. But then it’s probably not great either. If, instead of seeking approval, you ask, ‘what’s wrong with it? how can I make it better?’, you are more likely to get a truthful, critical answer. You may even get an improvement on your idea. And you are still in a position to reject the criticism if you think it is wrong.  
  14\. If you are involved in something that goes wrong, never blame others. Blame no one but yourself. If you have touched something, accept total responsibility for that piece of work. If you accept responsibility, you are in a position to do something about it. Whatever other people’s failings might be, you are the one to shoulder the responsibility. There are no excuses.  
  15\. In a meeting you don’t have to worry about how you are coming across to colleagues, because they are busy worrying about how they are coming across to you. Meetings are for those with not enough to do. A meeting is a performance, an act to convince people of their own importance. The real players don’t need to act out the meeting game. They roll up their sleeves and get on with the job.  
  16\. What is a good idea? One that happens is. If it doesn’t, it isn’t. When a client asked how much it would cost to get permission to photograph the Eiffel Tower for use in an advertisement, the bureaucrats representing the City of Paris said ten thousand pounds. The client didn’t think that was such a good idea any more. So they didn’t use it. I wanted it for this book, but I don’t think ten thousand pounds is such a good idea either. So I didn’t ask.  
  17\. What I find interesting about the Sydney Opera House is how the architect Jorn Utzon sold his outrageous and what was then unbuildable design to Sydney’s city fathers. When presenting his plans he referred to the building as a sail. Once the committee had the image of sails on the water, no other entrant in the architectural competition stood a chance. He summed up his concept in one word. Sail. Brilliant.  
  18\. Salomon Brothers, the well-known New York investment house, met with prospective clients not once a month or once a day, but three times a day. That’s unreasonable. But it works. Most people are reasonable, that’s why they only do reasonably well.  
  19\. Old Golfers don’t win — it’s a general rule. Why? Experience. He knows the downside, what happens if it goes wrong, which makes him more cautious. The young player is either ignorant or reckless to caution. That is his edge. Knowledge makes us play safe. The secret is to stay childish.  
  20\. In 1888 George Eastman changed the name for his photographic company to ‘Kodak’, an odd choice since it was meaningless. In those days nobody gave random names to serious products. Eastman’s reasons for choosing the name were that it was short; that it was not open to mispronunciation; and it could not be associated with anything else.

  1\. “Men die of boredom, psychological conflict and disease. They do not die of hard work.”  
  2\. “In the best establishments, promises are always kept, whatever it may cost in agony and overtime.”  
  3\. “Get rid of sad dogs who spread doom. Hire gentlemen with brains. Tolerate genius. Prefer the discipline of knowledge to the anarchy of ignorance.”  
  4\. “People do not buy from bad-mannered liars. Tell the truth but make the truth fascinating. Consumer is not a moron — she is your wife — do not insult her intelligence.”  
  5\. “I admire people with gentle manners who treat other people as human beings.”  
  6\. “Pay peanuts and you get monkeys.”  
  7\. “Once a salesman, always a salesman.”  
  8\. “Price-off deals are a drug. Ask a drug-addicted brand manager what happened to his share of the market after the delirium of the deal subsided. He will change the subject. Asking if the deal increased his profit. Again he will change the subject.”  
  9\. “What is the reason for one’s failure to study experience? Is it that any kind of scientific method is beyond his grasp? Is he afraid that knowledge would impose some discipline on them — or expose their incompetence?”  
  10\. “At Ogilvy, we make it a nice place to work. We put this first.”  
  11\. “We treat people like human beings. We help them when they are in trouble with their jobs, with illness, with alcoholism, and so on. We help them make the best of their talents, investing an awful lot of time and money in training-like a teaching hospital.”  
  12\. “Our system of management is singularly democratic. We don’t like hierarchical bureaucracy or rigid pecking orders. We give our executives an extraordinary degree of freedom and independence. We detest nepotism and every other form of favoritism. In promoting people to top jobs, we are influenced as much by their character as anything else. Our far-flung enterprise is held together by a network of personal friendships. We all belong to the same club.”  
  13\. “We like people with gentle manners. We like people who are honest in argument, honest with clients and, above all, honest with consumers. We admire people who work hard, who are objective and thorough. We detest office politicians, toadies, bullies, and pompous asses. We abhor ruthlessness.”  
  14\. “We have an infuriating habit of divine discontent with our performance. It is an antidote to smugness.”  
  15\. “American businessmen are not taught that it is a sin to bore your fellow creatures.”  
  16\. “I have never wanted to get an account so big that I could not afford to lose it. The day you do that, you commit yourself to living with fear. Frightened agencies lose the courage to give candid advice; once you lose that you become a lackey.”  
  17\. “The head of an agency has so much on his plate that he is apt to see his clients only at times of crisis. This is a mistake. If you get into the habit of seeing clients when the weather is calm, you will establish an easy relationship which may save your life when a storm blows up.”  
  18\. “It is important to admit your mistakes, and to do so before you are charged with them. Many clients are surrounded by buck-passers who make a fine art of blaming the agency for their own failures. I seize the earliest opportunity to assume the blame.”  
  19\. “Positioning… this curious verb is in great favor among marketing experts, but no two of them agree what it means. My own definition is ‘what the product does, and who it is for.’ I could have positioned Dove as a detergent bar for men with dirty hands, but chose instead to position it as a toilet bar for women with dry skin. This is still working 25 years later. In Norway, the SAAB car had no measurable profile. We positioned it as a car for winter. Three years later it was voted the best car for Norwegian winters.”  
  20\. “I do not regard advertising as entertainment or an art form, but as a medium of information. When I write an advertisement, I don’t want you to tell me that you find it ‘creative’. I want you to find it so interesting that you buy the product. When Aeschines spoke, they said, ‘How well he speaks.’ But when Demosthenes spoke, they said, ‘Let us march against Philip.’

Few brief observations about audio and voice…

  1\. Podcasts are everywhere and advertising spend on podcasts are climbing. They are easy to produce and distribute, thanks to platforms such as \[anchor.fm\](https://anchor.fm). And great content of course, e.g. Seth Godin’s \[akimbo.me\](http://akimbo.me).  
  2\. There are more audiobook options than ever. Amazon’s acquisition of Audible is making more sense everyday.  
  3\. You can now ask Amazon Echo or the Alexa app to “read you” books from your Amazon Kindle library. You can ask Pocket to “read you” your blog articles as well. You can now “listen to YouTube” if you subscribe. Consumption models that are based on watching and reading are also turning to audio as an option.  
  4\. Google Assistant is now available as a Widget on iOS, and it’s almost the first thing you interact with on Android. Recommended way to interact with iOS Shortcuts is through Siri. No surprises perhaps — they need to keep that friendly competition going with Amazon Echo / Alexa.  
  5\. And an Apple Watch now supports Walkie Talkie and makes phone calls. It’s telling that these two fascinating facts feel like old news.

Happy new year\! 🥳

ps. How can I forget? You can now of course “text” using your voice on any messaging app to type your message or send it as audio.

\#\# Summary

Replace internal and external webinars with a better engagement model.

\#\# Description

Webinars are very stiff: schedule a speaker, book everyone’s calendar, click to logon to the webinar at that specific 1 hour period during that 40 hour work week. Everything is pre-set, engagement is limited (last 5 mins of the webinar for Q\&A), and all experts stick to the script that they have worked on. It’s not real-time, it does not fell 100% honest.

There is absolutely no equivalent of this type of engagement in our social lives. If we want to call a friend and get her opinion about a topic.. we text or call. We do not rely on a middle man to setup a webinar to have a chat. How can we move customer engagement by corporate organizations in B2B markets in this direction?

Considering how valuable webinars are to many of us for lead generation, imagine what this type of a mobile app powered model would do to your marketing efforts in terms of getting in touch with new audiences. Then there is the immediate benefit of enabling honest, open, continuous communication between your target audience outside the company and your experts: imagine how much more these experts can learn from this audience about their problems and success stories — about what’s working and what’s not.

\#\# Features

  \* Build a mobile app that offers a simple category selection of experts, with internal-only and public segmentation based on user identity  
  \* Enable experts on topics of interest to mark their available “virtual office hours” — these are your most valuable players internally, product owners, engineers, sales and marketing professionals, support staff and anyone who has tribal knowledge  
  \* Enable users to book their calendar in 10 — 20 — 30 mins increments with a single tap, followed by a confirmation (reject or accept) of their request by the expert  
  \* Give the option to the expert to keep the meeting public or private, and tag the conversation within a certain category  
  \* Users who have shown interest in a similar topic can choose to get notified about this upcoming meeting, if it is marked public  
  \* To engage with folks who are not using this app, we can rely on social and email marketing to create the viral loop using the existing content as the bait  
  \* At the time of the “meeting”, everyone jumps on the mobile broadcast — questions are primarily asked via chat, answered with audio/video

\#\# Admin actions

  \* Create and delete topics and their descriptions with image(s)  
  \* Create, edit and delete features and their descriptions with image(s)  
  \* Ban users from using the app, delete offending comments  
  \* Topic and feature list can be customized anytime  
  \* Profile page with editable bio, title, topics and experts followed  
  \* Create a new expert with bio and pic and topic assignments  
  \* Create a new topic with description, icon and expert assignments  
  \* Delete an expert or a topic

\#\# Summary

Make mobile the primary vehicle in delivering internal and external communication. Either via a dedicated mobile app or via existing options such as Slack, Yammer or others. In either case, make mobile the primary (and sometimes the only) option.

\#\# Description

In our social lives, we do not have these things called distribution lists.. we rely on much more than email newsletters to consume information.. and be alerted of “news”. We subscribe to the topics (e.g. election coverage on CNN) and people (e.g. blog authors) we like, and we are notified on my mobile app instantly when something happens on a topic that we care about.

Emails are useful when curated right and they are absolutely required… but emails are sent after the fact and they serve as “summary of information” with links to resources as opposed to real-time engagement and news. I think at this day and age, organizations in the B2B market are losing an opportunity to improve their game in delivering this curated data on the scale of a mobile app, based on the identity of their audiences — internal or external — and their topic preferences.

Through this strategy, one way bi-weekly or monthly email newsletter updates will turn itself into a real-time 24/7 communication about what you do and how you do it. Data around engagement statistics will inform the nature and content of your next announcement and publication, per audience. If you do it right, our advocates will not only talk about how good your products are, they will start raving about how you communicate with them on a daily basis.

\#\# Features

  \* Extend the ability to learn about the latest news from your org with weekly top-5 headliners, without having to read what all our website has to offer. Enable comments on specific news. Homepage of the app should simply list these 5 news (each of which can contain videos, images and text) after the user has logged in. Top-5 news articles should be archived at up to 90 days.  
  \* Build a mobile app that offers a simple selection of topics and authors, with internal-only and public segmentation based on user identity.  
  \* Categories would be the same ones we offer on your internal and external websites: solution areas, products, Human Resources, operations, etc.  
  \* Authors would include folks who contribute: product managers, support, marketing, among others. Enable everyone to select the topics that they are interested in “following” and “follow” the authors that they care about.  
  \* When there is a new update from the author or on the topic of interest, folks get a notification on their mobile device, real-time engagement kicks off. They can comment on the “news” and start chatting with the author of the article and others interested in that “news”.

\#\# Admin actions

  \* Create and delete news articles and rank them from 1 to 5\.  
  \* Ban users from using the app, delete offending comments.  
  \* News list can be customized at anytime; no app updates required.  
  \* Access content usage reports, user & topic leaderboards.  
  \* Most engaging news (comment count) leaderboards.  
  \* Manage topic, weekly, monthly notifications.

\#\# User actions

  \* Edit their bio profile brief, change their profile picture.  
  \* User profile page should list the news they commented on in the past 90 days.  
  \* Can share the public news article using email, twitter, facebook, linkedin.

Mobile is leading the way in grabbing attention and digital engagement.

Yet, as corporations, we do not take a mobile-first approach in engaging with our employees, business partners and customers. It should really be no different compared to how you interact with your friends and family.

Mobile also extends to smart home tech and voice assistants — its standing in improving everyday life here will surely extend to work life sooner or later.

If you are part of an executive staff, a product team or a marketing organization, you can take the following tangible actions in an effort to embrace mobile-first:

  1\. You can make sure that every single piece of content on our website is mobile friendly. You can remove all the PDFs, stop writing a novel on a webpage and get rid of all the 60-min webinar recordings.  
  2\. You can spend your time and money to attack existing real-estate on smartphones: a podcast series for internal audiences sharing news about your organization almost weekly, a much improved YouTube channel for external audiences that aims to teach, an honest strategy around Instagram targeting influencers, among others.  
  3\. You can make sure that every collateral created for consumption by your field and inside sales is mobile friendly: where else do you expect them to spend most of their time while trying to close deals on the go?  
  4\. Your community likes to ask and answer questions on a dedicated website with many groups of forums, sure. But with a mobile-first approach, you can aim to extend your reach beyond the MVPs.  
  5\. When communicating with your core audience over email, you can make sure that the images, videos, links and text are mobile friendly. More than anything else, it shows that you care about the message you are trying to deliver.  
  6\. Taking advantage of your mobile apps, length of your messages can be “rightsized”, forcing you to get to the point quickly and deliver your message more effectively via push notifications and voice assistant skills.

\> Taking the mobile-first approach will not only make you more effective during your day-to-day. It will actually help you differentiate against your competition by running a tighter ship. It would positively impact how you do what you do.

Looking at the networking industry — which I have been part of for many years — Cisco has gained the respect and dedication of many network engineers out there by executing on a simple plan intentionally or unintentionally. They married what they do and the technical information they have gathered to the way people consumed information and educated themselves: textbooks and in-classroom training. And then they carried out a similar strategy when they had to move that content over to the web as internet became more and more accessible. Those network engineers grew up to be the directors of IT, CIOs and CSOs of today. And then they stopped, that was the end of the road for them in terms of community engagement, information sharing, gaining mindshare… they had trained folks on a cutting edge technology in the best way they can, with the tools available at the time, and they have been reaping the benefits ever since.

Lesson learned from Cisco’s example: a strong community of customers and partners can become the cornerstone of your brand and culture — \_using the best and most engaging tools of the time\_ — and help you beat your competition.

On mobile, the way your audience engages with your data (e.g. sales reports) and content (e.g. your latest product release) promises to be \_much\_ more social and interactive. You can follow up on the promise and make a conscious decision not to call any major initiative “done” unless it is also powered by a mobile engagement strategy. You can create the expectation for all involved that you run your business on mobile. A mobile-first approach will also give you a great chance and a logical excuse to politely reject legacy business processes that are in place.

\> Next article, I will share few app ideas that can help you make the move to mobile-first.

Every product and marketing team has an outline for their ideal sales call — where the sales team can be effective, answer all the tough questions in the right way, position the product and services offer against the right budget center. They prefer to see all of these right moves contribute to faster sales growth and product adoption. Well, as we all know, there are always imperfections in the process.

One thing that members of every product team can do is to actually create this ideal sales call, virtually. As you create the written, audio and video content, this can be setup as a tangible goal in terms of the results of the project.

With such a goal in mind, you can also move to deliver on one of the common asks from your sales teams: take a customer-in approach, focusing on the specific, business impacting use cases your customers usually have in mind. In order to create the perfect sales call using digital assets, you of course have to take this customer-in approach… since you cannot possibly imagine a sales team talking about whatever they want to during an actual sales call, instead of responding to customer questions.

Each audio and video recording would ideally be less than 5 minutes. They do not have to be highly polished expensive video assets and can be produced using internal resources. You can use the following agenda for each:

  \* Introduction to the business problem,  
  \* Market trends and highlights that build on top of this problem,  
  \* What you prescribe to eliminate the headache and prepare for the future,  
  \* Why you are the best partner to help them get there,  
  \* And product demonstrations to re-emphasize your unique value prop.

It takes a long time to setup a sales call with a customer and connect with their business problem. The crucial moments of a sales call is usually measured in mins, not hours. A well-crafted piece of content should aim to replicate those valuable moments.

\#\# Suggestions on distribution

  1\. Pitch list: video library that’s searchable, social share for each video, each video with an audio-only replica next to it, can add to a real-time playlists. This is the “presentation” part of a sales call.  
  2\. Expert list: each with a bio, with their own personal playlist, with links to their social profiles and to their past and upcoming Q\&A sessions. This is the “get to meet the expert” part of a sales call.  
  3\. Demo video list: video library that’s searchable, social share for each video, can add to a real-time playlist. This is the “let’s see it in action” part of a sales call.  
  4\. Podcast links: All videos in one RSS feed, all audio in a separate RSS feed.  
  5\. YouTube links: Video libraries also featured here for easy access and promotion.  
  6\. Question form: Time to ask questions to get their view on what was just presented.

\#\# Not for the audience, with the audience

We all used to publish presentations, videos, whitepapers, guides for the audience to consume. That’s no longer enough. The content you now produce needs to incorporate audience viewpoint as it reaches its final version. It’s a story that connects what you do to how they want to consume what you are trying to explain in what format. Technologies used in content production are now capable of connecting the dots. A video needs to include comments and “remix” from the ones who consume it. A written content needs to evolve with the comments it drives. A presentation needs to ask as many questions as it answers. A series of content that makes the audience part of its existence will survive in the long run.

\#\# Must grow with referrals, not with ads

Referrals by the fans of your product, content, research is the path for true growth. For a while now, we have been thinking that if we win the Google search game, we are good. Well, no longer. The more fans you have who contribute to what you do, the more valuable content you can produce. And the larger fan base you can create, the more they will share what you do. Fans, influencers, followers will drive more business for you than your best demand-gen program that drives clicks, views, downloads.

\#\# Machine learning is no longer rocket science

Better content, crafted in partnership with your core audience. Best ones shared among your new and old fans. The demand for increased attention to detail in personalizing messages for announcements, industry news, research articles and new product introductions will follow next. Since we humans are not very good at remembering all the gory details of who, with what type of topic interests, from which country and level of expertise would care about what type of content next — asking a machine to figure out the answers for suggested articles and content is perfectly normal. Thankfully none of this is too hard to deliver personalized and highly targeted content for your fans. They will appreciate you being smart about it — and you will continue to put their priorities and interests first, instead of yours.

This post is inspired by this great presentation on the story of Tasty:

When you put people first…

You ask them to contribute their fair share after you do whatever is in your power to deliver them the best compensation plan there is in your respective industry.

You take action every year to help the 10% who have been identified to underperform find the next stop in their professional careers.

You do not allow office politicians and bullies survive, no matter how good they are with your customers or for the business — since in the long run they cause more pain than gain, and it is the right thing to do for all impacted.

You setup a clear product vision and strategy since your best people will demand to stay inspired for the road ahead: you won’t be able to sweep the challenge under the rug by saving the day with a diving catch for that customer escalation. The reward and recognition system won’t allow it.

You pay close attention to the craft of the creators in the team . Winning customers won’t be enough — others in the team and you will start demanding their best work available in your industry.

You spend hours in perfecting the culture code for the team as people contribute to make it better every day, every week. The level of effort put forward by all is usually directly proportional to how much the business had invested in them over time.

Then those people take care of your customers no matter what. They take pride in it. It unofficially becomes their job description. It ends up being the standard operating procedure. They will start protecting them from not so well thought-through decisions made by the business. They will put the community they helped create before anything else.

Song of the blog comes from Istanbul —

Tune in while you read:

Besides the habits of your audience, there is a constant need to pay attention to your team’s culture as you bring your product to market. Engineering, product management, support, marketing and everyone in between. Shipping a product is a team’s sport — as a team leader or a functional lead, your job is to create the best working environment possible and serve at the pleasure of your team members before you ask for a great performance in return.

My tips 👇

💪 Take immediate action against anyone that brings personal attacks and bullying to the workplace. There is no “may be, or could be, or what if” as part of this. If you are a manager or a team member, you have to be very black and white. It does not matter how “good” someone is when it comes to the work they do: that’s table stakes.

👨🏼‍🎤 At every 1:1 with your direct reports who are people managers, always ask about people first — “how is your team and what can we do better for them?” Show empathy and convert to action with follow-up when necessary. Your products or your balance sheets do not run your company — people do. They will eventually graduate from your organization and start their own venture — and in five years, they won’t remember what you built together as much as they remember the people in it and how you all did it.

🧐 When things don’t go your way, when the inevitable random events hit your doorstep, use common sense. Train your common sense to act quickly. Openly discussing tough decisions and conversations will help you in the long run. Stay stoic about it, eliminate emotions. Act in accordance to what’s in the best interest of the team, and then based on what’s best for the business.

Happy Friday & weekend\!

🎶🙏👍🏼🤘🍻

“We did some research and discovered that when people were going to serve soft drinks to a friend in their home, if they had Coca-Cola (KO) in the fridge, they would go out to the kitchen, open the fridge, take out the Coke bottle, bring it out, put it on the table, and pour a glass in front of their guests. If it was a Pepsi, they would go out into the kitchen, take it out of the fridge, open it, and pour it in a glass in the kitchen, and only bring the glass out. The point was people were embarrassed to have someone know that they were serving Pepsi. Maybe they would think it was Coke, because Coke had a better perception. It was a better necktie. Steve \[Jobs\] was fascinated by that.”

WHY: What is your purpose, cause, belief? Why does it exist? Why should anyone care?

What \-\> How \-\> Why (Outside In) (90% of marketing/sales)    
“We make great computers” (What is it?)    
“They are beautifully designed, easy to use” (How is it different?)    
… “Wanna buy one?”

Why \-\> How \-\> What (Inside out) (10% of marketing sales)    
“Everything we do, we believe in challenging the status quo, we believe in thinking differently” (Why?)    
“The way we challenge status quo is to make our products beatifully designed, easy to use” (How?)    
“We just happened to make great computers” (What?)    
… “Wanna buy one?”

Buyers: 2.5% innovators \+ 13.5% early adopters (=Tipping Point 15-16%) \+ 34% early majority \+ 34% late majority \+ 16% laggards

The goal is not to do business with everybody who needs what you have… the goal is to do business with people who believe what you believe… people don’t buy what you do, they buy why you do it.

Feelings (Trust and Loyalty) are responsible for all human behavior and decision making. “what you do” is only used to rationalize “why you do it” and “what people buy” is only the proof “why you do it”.
