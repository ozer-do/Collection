# Ubyon

**Power of community**

Community networks are hard to build but also hard to beat.

Ubyon has a chance to heavily influence app developers (within a large scale single enterprise or SaaS-enabled product companies that target enterprise B2B) as they interact with multi-cloud environments (public, private, edge) and accelerate the speed of their product and solution development: real-time testing, troubleshooting, bug fixing, software upgrades, new feature rollouts, release cycle management, among others.

Ubyon eliminates the complexity of role based secure access to cloud resources powering such applications. Rules of access can be defined across engineering teams, small or large, with developer identity, group, credential and other similar factors in mind. Level of access can be defined on a per feature, release, micro-service and other similar factors.

With a framework that enables developer-friendly workflows, for the first time in large scale software development, Ubyon dashboard makes it possible to translate the language of security, compliance and access control to software developers.

**Target problem**

Any size enterprise is getting digitized by the minute. Each digitization effort comes with a multi-factor problem on ‚Äúhow are we going to acquire/develop, rollout, secure, maintain these apps?‚Äù Apps can interact with physical spaces and people in it, remote workers around the world, IoT and machine infrastructure rolling out in industrial spaces, and so on.

To match the need of enterprise requirements, software developers have been relying on public clouds - but that‚Äôs also changing. Developing at the edge, across private clouds and multiple public clouds is the new normal for enterprise apps.

This begs the second question: ‚Äúhow are we going to secure and control access for app developers across multi-clouds without compromising speed of innovation?‚Äù

**Audience profile**

Each engineer is an artist in its own way. Translating an idea to the real world with constant attention to detail in the app experiences, front- or back-end, that they create. When they are slowed down by security and access controls - especially with complex compute architectures in place - each of these artists enable their own version of software maintenance.

Back doors to key specific features and micro-services become the standard mode of operation, and secret pass-phrases that give admin access to logs, patch updates, real-time bug fixing become the new normal. Opening the door to multiple regulatory and compliance issues, and creating a massive security risk for app developers themselves and their end customers.

**Simplicity of adoption**

Ubyon dashboard has been designed with ease of use in mind, enabling engineers to easily access the specific app development environments they are trying to get to with their real-time context in mind‚Ä¶ without remembering exact server namespaces, IP addresses, authentication requirements, and other similar factors.

While access control to different development environments have so far been a chore for engineers, this changes with Ubyon.

Keeping track of security policies for each environment is no longer required. Such policies are not distributed but rather centralized: as Ubyon acts as the translator between software dev workflows and security / control policies in place.

üí° For initial onboarding of new customers and/or new engineering teams - contributing further to the value prop that ‚ÄúUbyon will make my life easy‚Äù and also to make sure Ubyon as an organization does few ‚Äúunscalable things‚Äù during its early days - Ubyon should offer a free service to integrate Ubyon within an existing dev environment.

Free service instead of asking engineers on the other end to do the work.

This will also provide significant insights on product ease of use, key new features required, important software dev workflows for that specific customer, among many others. The customer success function here should start right away during the initial trial and continue during the initial larger scale install.

**[More usage = more value]** **Promotion mix by audience**

Ubyon dashboard, workflows, translations.. have been designed with the day-to-day challenges of software engineers in mind. As they take advantage of simplified / accelerated operational models, we expect them to act as advocates for Ubyon and share its benefits further within their teams, their companies and across communities that they are part of.

We expect them to ‚Äútake Ubyon with them‚Äù wherever they go as a next venture, whichever app that they work on next. Simple act of collaboration on the next app or feature will automatically enable a Ubyon user to share its capabilities with other engineers on the project.

As a result, adoption of the solution can start with one engineer, one team, one department. And can grow or shrink in size as the needs of different teams change. It is designed to move at the speed of development required by such engineering teams, rather than become ‚Äúyet another process to follow‚Äù for engineers as they try to innovate.

üí° Go-to-customer motion, supported by product-led growth tactics used to promote Ubyon, should be designed with this in mind. We want community advocacy first, and then prioritize traditional enterprise sales motion. This will pay dividends in the long run.

**[More usage = more value]** **Multiplier effect**

Ubyon is itself a multi-cloud powered enterprise app. As a result, it has been delivered with modern software architecture baked in. So.. while it accelerates the way developers work, it is also ready for developers.

Existing software development workflows, scripts, processes that are already in place can take advantage of Ubyon‚Äôs powerful translations for secure access control to compute environments via APIs, instead of having to rely on Ubyon dashboard at every step.

üí° Ubyon‚Äôs key advantage here is two folds: (1) core audience has already been identified as software developers so adoption of its developer APIs will have limited friction if any, and (2) being able to prove easy integration with existing engineering workflows will further deepen its presence among its community members.

ORY TO COMPLETE | **Why Ubyon vs others?**

Ubyon is a ‚Äúdifferent fork on the road‚Äù vs. the continuation of the same old software development workflows. Add 1-2-3 arguments to support this fact - for those customers who might ask.

Key here is.. competitive differentiation starts with Ubyon‚Äôs company / product positioning.. and then addresses the capabilities of the competition. You never want to start by responding to the capabilities of existing players. If you do, you already lost.

ORY TO COMPLETE | **Data lakes for sustainability**

Once Ubyon starts supporting software development workflows for 100s of teams out there.. it will gain access to significantly valuable data on software development ecosystem and private | public | edge cloud adoption metrics across industries. The data lake that gets created will then be as valuable as Ubyon‚Äôs product and its developer community.. creating the third competitive advantage for Ubyon.

ORY TO COMPLETE | **Roadmap and campaigns to get there**

Identify the company, product and people roadmap to get to where you want to go. Define 3-5 key initiatives across the company as campaigns. Recommend sticking to 3. And more than 5, no one can remember. Here is a template to use to define each campaign. It served me well over the years during my time at Aruba Meridian and at Celona.

ORY TO COMPLETE | **What‚Äôs the investment ask?**

If this is your community vision from product to customer, and your vision to run the organization as a collection of key campaigns, how can the board members and new investors help you?
