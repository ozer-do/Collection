Proxy metrics as a competitive advantage. Predict user / customer behaviour considering what has happened to that customer over the course of its timeline… and predict what could happen for the customers in that same theatre, business, usage patterns. Experiment with new features for a select group of customers who represent “the golden sample” of customers, where if the product succeeds, would give an highly likely chance of the feature being successful in the remaining set of customers.

Meridian needs to become an event-driven SaaS business: not something that takes advantage of an algorithm and a set of database functions, but rather learns from the activities outside of its domain and control, in an effort to optimise itself. The responsibility to educate our audience on why cloud computing matters to our business, is ours. We need to show them “why” it is important for us to be a cloud based service - with the advantages it brings. Besides business intelligence, event-driven SaaS model is a big reason.

Can we move the Wi-Fi industry to Industrial Internet? Buy Wi-Fi APs as a service: we monitor your usage patterns, we charge per usage, highlight a need to service when things break, take care of your business intelligence reporting, etc. Besides the event driven SaaS model, this could be the thing that would break us apart compared to the traditional networking vendors.
